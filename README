MythTV Translation Status
=========================


OVERVIEW

MythTV [1] is a leading open source personal video recorder (PVR), 
built on the Qt4 toolkit.  It uses features in this toolkit to 
provide translations of its graphical interfaces in many languages 
(27 languages as of January 2011).  In order to improve the level of 
translation for all supported languages it is important to be able to 
monitor how complete support for each language is.

The MythTV Translation Status tool is a collection of shell and Perl 
scripts that analyses the current production and stable release code 
for MythTV, and produces HTML output  that includes:

i)  a summary page showing the overall percentage completion of all 
    translatable strings for all supported languages; and
ii) a detailed summary page on a per-component basis showing the actual 
    number of translated strings for all supported languages

The summary page shows 10 sets of results per language (the current 
results and 9 historic results).

Scripts are provided to allow analysis of both Qt3 and Qt4-based releases
of MythTV.

LAYOUT

Files included with MythTV Translation Status are:

tools/      the shell and Perl scripts that perform the translation analysis
            for current Qt4-based versions of MythTV
tools/qt3   replacement scripts that enable the translation analysis
            for pre-0.22 Qt3-based versions of MythTV

templates/  the Template::Toolkit templates and CSS file used to produce the 
            HTML output.

CONFIGURATION

Before running the status tool, a local clone of the MythTV git repository 
[2] is required.  Please note that this tool currently removes all locally 
modified files from the local repository  (git reset --hard) so you may 
want to run this tool on a separate clone of the MythTV code.

All required configuration is performed in the configuration section of the 
check-outstanding-* shell scripts.  Configuration sections are:

i)   the locations of the Qt4 lupdate and lrelease tools;
ii)  the locations of the MythTV Translation Status tools and templates;
iii) the location of the local git clone of the MythTV source code;
iv)  the desired root output directory for all results; and
v)   the branch to analyse and output directory for branch's results

Note that once configured, you will only need to change settings if you want 
to start monitoring another branch of the code. In this case you will need 
to update the "Branch-specific settings" settings to avoid overwriting 
existing results.

RUNNING THE STATUS TOOL

To run the MythTV Translation Status tool, run:

tools/check-outstanding-master - to analyse the translation status of the 
                                 current 'master' branch; or
tools/check-outstanding-fixes  - to analyse the translation status of the 
                                 configured 'fixes' branch

These scripts call all other required scripts automatically. In normal 
usage, no other programs need to be called manually. However, the 
tools/revert-dirs script can be called to roll-back one set of results 
at a time if required.


ANALYSING OLD RELEASES OF MYTHTV

Versions of MythTV prior to 0.22 were built using the Qt3 toolkit. Specfic 
Qt3-based replacement scripts for testing old versions of MythTV are provided
and are found in the tools/qt3 directory. These scripts should replace the
identically-named scripts in tools/.


VIEWING THE RESULTS

Each branch's output directory contains an index.html file that can be 
viewed to see that branch's results and also navigate to other branches 
that have been tested.


ISSUES/FUTURE WORK

The multiple tools/check-outstanding-* scripts could be combined into a 
single script that could take the desired branch to anaylse as a runtime 
argument on the command line. This would reduce duplication and makes 
it easier to check multiple branches. It is very likely this will be 
implemented in the future.

Template generation may also generate warnings to the console if it is 
run when there are fewer than 9 sets of historic results available. 
Support to ignore these warnings may be added in the future.

The tool currently requires manual editing of the HTML results in order to 
add links to new branches that are analysed and are not listed in the 
templates used to generate the output. Support to do this automatically 
may be added in the future.
